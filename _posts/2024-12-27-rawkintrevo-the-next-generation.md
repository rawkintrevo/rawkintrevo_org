# Rawkintrevo: The Next Generation

The past few years have been transformative, both personally and professionally. The journey began with my foray into publishing—a monumental achievement in my career. Writing and publishing 
[Kubeflow for Machine Learning from Lab to Production](https://www.amazon.com/Kubeflow-Machine-Learning-Lab-Production/dp/1492050121) was a significant milestone, marking not just the accomplishment of a life-long dream, but also solidifying my expertise in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. This endeavor pushed me to distill complex concepts into accessible knowledge, influencing countless professionals and enthusiasts eager to harness the power of Kubeflow for their machine learning initiatives.

Amidst this achievement, I made a pivotal decision to leave my position at IBM, stepping into the world of consultancy. This shift was driven by a desire to focus on Kubeflow, leveraging my newfound influence and knowledge. The consultancy provided me with immense insights, exposing me to a diverse range of challenges across different industries. This period of my life was all about growth—learning to flexibly adapt to the needs of various clients while continuously exploring the breadth of Kubeflow's capabilities.

On a more personal note, the decision to embrace a car-free lifestyle emerged around this time. Shedding my reliance on cars resonated deeply with my values, emphasizing sustainability and mindful living. The change wasn't just logistical but philosophical, as it reshaped my perspective on urban living, transportation, and environmental stewardship. This transition has been significant, influencing not only my daily routines but also reinforcing a commitment to broader societal change.

Perhaps the most transformative of all has been the expansion of our family, welcoming two wonderful kids into the world. Parenthood is an unparalleled milestone, one that has redefined my priorities and perspectives. The joys and challenges of raising young children have profoundly shaped my worldview, teaching me patience, empathy, and the art of balancing personal aspirations with family responsibilities. Being a parent has undoubtedly impacted the lens through which I view both my personal and professional endeavors, infusing them with a greater sense of purpose and urgency.

Each of these milestones played a crucial role in shaping the narrative of where I am today. They collectively embody a journey of growth, change, and newfound clarity, setting the stage for exciting ventures and directions for 'rawkintrevo.org' moving forward.

## Entrepreneurial Pursuits and Corporate Return

Starting my own venture with [Electric Elk](https://electricelk.co/) was an exhilarating leap into entrepreneurship that felt both natural and slightly daunting. The inspiration for this cargo e-bike company grew from a deep-seated belief in sustainable transportation and a desire to create solutions that could help urbanites live more efficiently. Having embraced a car-free lifestyle myself, I was keenly aware of the potential for e-bikes to transform how we handle logistics and commuting in bustling cities. The journey taught me a wealth of practical business insights, from product development to engaging in grassroots marketing and building a community of eco-conscious supporters.

However, as any entrepreneur knows, the path is not without its challenges. It was a period of intense learning, adaptation, and occasional frustration. Yet, these experiences fostered personal growth and resilience. The lessons I garnered from navigating the complexities of a startup have been invaluable—fueling both my passion for sustainable urban solutions and my professional capabilities.

My return to IBM, however, marked another pivotal chapter. The prospect of working with their pioneering quantum computing team was an opportunity I simply couldn’t resist. IBM’s continued commitment to groundbreaking advancements in technology aligned seamlessly with my ambitions. Transitioning back to corporate life after entrepreneurship was a unique experience—I found myself appreciating the structured ecosystem of a large organization while bringing a refreshed perspective from the dynamic startup environment.

Adjusting to this shift required a recalibration of my mindset. I embraced the collaborative atmosphere and the wealth of resources that IBM offers, which starkly contrasts with the more intimate, fast-paced nature of running a startup. This juxtaposition has enriched my career, merging innovative entrepreneurial thinking with the rigor and scale of a leading tech corporation.

As I reflect on these diverse experiences, I realize how they have collectively enriched both my personal and professional journey. Each experience has been a critical building block, contributing to a broader understanding of the tech industry’s diverse landscapes and preparing me for new ventures ahead.

## The AI Revolution and New Beginnings

The world of artificial intelligence has always been one of rapid change and fascinating possibilities, and the recent introduction of ChatGPT marks a significant point in this journey. Witnessing its impact first-hand on my former team was nothing short of astonishing. ChatGPT and similar models have transformed how we approach problem-solving, communication, and even creativity. It’s not just reshaping business strategies; it’s altering the very ways in which we think about AI’s potential to augment human intelligence.

I’ve had the privilege of meeting numerous researchers and developers deeply embedded in the field of AI. Conversations with these brilliant minds have been eye-opening, offering insights into their innovative approaches and the challenges they face. Many are committed to ethical AI development, ensuring that as we push the boundaries of what machines can do, we remain aware of the societal implications. Their resilience and foresight enrich our understanding of AI, providing a necessary compass as we venture into largely uncharted territories.

Currently, my role with the [AI Alliance](https://thealliance.ai/) feels like a natural progression in my professional journey. The position aligns seamlessly with my passion for innovation and offers an incredible platform to influence the future of AI in meaningful ways. Working with the AI Alliance opens doors to collaborate on groundbreaking projects and engage with a global network of thought leaders. It’s a thrilling experience to be at the heart of such transformative work, where technology and human potential intertwine.

Every day, I’m reminded of how far we’ve come and how much potential lies ahead. The journey has been adventurous, challenging, and profoundly rewarding, paving the way for exciting new chapters in both my professional and personal narratives.
